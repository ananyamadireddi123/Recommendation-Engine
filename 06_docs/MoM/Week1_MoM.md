### `Learner-centric model`
A learner-centric educational model is inverted from the traditional model, as it shifts the focus from teacher-led instructions
based environment to active, personalized and student-driven learning

$$Putting\ Students\ First$$

Here are some of the key highlights about the model:

* **Individualized learning** : acknowledges and caters to diverse learning styles, backgrounds, and paces
* **Active engagement** : promotes hands-on exploration, problem-solving, and critical thinking rather than passive knowledge
ingestion
* **Meaningful feedback** : provides ongoing, personalized feedback to guide and motivate learners



### `Delivery-centric model`
The traditional delivery-centric educational model rather prioritizes the efficient & effective delivery of pre-defined content as the
primary driver of learning.

$$Content\ At\ Forefront$$

Some of the key highlights about this model are as below:
* **Standardized curriculum** : follows a structured syllabus and established learning progression across all students
* **Uniform pace and expectations** : all students progress through the same material at the same time
* **Teacher-led instructions** : relies heavily on lectures, explanations, and demonstrations by an expert instructor
